# A Contract With Myself
My mind is the problem. I have become far too good at gestures and not action, creating a simulated-self with true depth, emotional resilience, and action-oriented drive, all the while allowing the real me to stagnate and numb to the world around me. “I’m not that far away from the kind of person I’d be proud to be. But if I don’t close the distance; I might calcify into something hollow.” Recognizing what's necessary is no longer good enough. If I do not start to become what I could be, I fear I never will.

## Term
30 consecutive days, July 13th, 2025 and ending on the August 12th.

### Daily Execution Rule
Each calendar day I will complete one meaningful external action and record it.

#### Accepted actions:
* A short video posted publicly
* A message or email sent to a real person
* A public post sharing an insight, update, or creative work

Quality is irrelevant. If it is not stored, it did not happen.

## Truth Lock
All actions are logged in execution-log.md
Weekly, the log is shared by push to GitHub.

## Penalty Ladder
Apply the following punishments if days are missed, and log it.

1. 24 hour media blackout + >= 3 sentence reflection in log + 50 push-ups
2. 100 push-ups + >= 3 sentence reflection in log
3. Start over from day one + 1,000 push-ups + >= 3 sentence reflection in log

## Daily Ritual
Every day at 20:00
Open execution-log.md.
Record today’s action with link.

Say aloud: Done is better than imagined. Done is proof I exist.

If no action logged, apply penalty immediately.
